/*
  Click counter app
  -----------------

  Create a simple web page with the following components:
  - an indicator of how many times a button has been clicked
  - the button whose clicks shall be counted

  Place both of them in the middle of the page. The button shall be below the number.

  Inside the app:
  The counter's state shall have two public members:
  - count
  - inc()

  See the provided test cases for behaviour.
  Note that calling .inc() may be the ONLY possibility to manipulate .count!
